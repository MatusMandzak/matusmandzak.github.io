## About
Hello, I'm Matúš, alias "buffyo". I come from Slovakia and I was born in 2005. I am currently an undergraduade student at Technical Unversity of Košice with focus on cybersecurity. I love CTF, hacking and anything that's intereting enough. Currently I'm part of [Slovak Cyber Team](https://cyberteam.sk/), where I specialize on binary exploitation (and reverse engineering). I have also competed in European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) as part of Team Slovakia (2024-2025). I believe the best way to learn is by doing and sharing knowledge with others. In the future I am looking to specialize in vulnerability research. Amongst the other things, I love to play volleyball and do photography.
