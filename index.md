## About
Matúš, 19yo, student who talks to software in a language it wasn't meant to understand. Probably discovered the magic of computing not in "Hello, World!" but in making a program crash on purpose. Believes "segmentation fault" isn't just an error, but an invitation.  While his classmates learned Python, he started learning the secret dialects of memory and registers. He doesn't just talk to computers; he convinces them to spill their secrets.

Studies computer science by day to learn the rules, and binary exploitation by night to break them. He’s not a master yet, just a dedicated student on a quest to become fluent in pwning. Fueled by a passion for research and the belief that the most interesting code is the part that isn't supposed to run.
