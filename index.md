## About
Heyyyyy :)

I’m a 19-year-old with a deep interest in cybersecurity, currently student in Slovakia. I’m passionate about many areas of IT especially software security and binary exploitation, however I consider myself master on none, always willing to learn and explore new areas. I love doing CTF’s with focus on pwn.
